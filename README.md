# Diceroll-cpp
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AnthonySuper/diceroll-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AnthonySuper/diceroll-cpp)


## What is it?

A re-implementation of the dice-rolling core of [FifthedSim](https://github.com/AnthonySuper/fifthedSim) in C++.
I wrote this to see how difficult it would be to implement some fairly complex Ruby code in C++.
As it turns out, it wasn't really that bad (so far).
You can expect to see a blog post about it soon.

## How can I use it?

Download and use it as a CMake library.
I think it's set up to work like that correctly.
Hopefully.

## Is there documentation?
Type `doxygen` with Doxygen installed, and it will generate into `/documentation`.
Note that the documentation is not nearly complete.
